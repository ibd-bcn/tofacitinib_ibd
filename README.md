__Background and Aims:__ Tofacitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor, is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. Nonetheless, 40-60% of patients will not respond adequately. The mechanisms underlying responses to tofacitinib remain unknown.

__Methods:__ We applied __single-cell__ and/or __bulk RNA__ analysis to biopsies (n=23 and 63, respectively) from ulcerative colitis patients (n= 31) before and after tofacitinib treatment. Response was assessed using endoscopic and clinical criteria. In vitro-derived macrophages and primary intestinal fibroblasts were used to validate our findings.
