# Single-cell RNAseq temporal analysis of ulcerative colitis patients undergoing tofacitinib treatment reveals a shift in myeloid cells towards pro-inflammatory phenotypes in refractory patients.

The variability and unpredictability of drug efficacy in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, including tofacitinib, an oral JAK1 and JAK3 inhibitor, remains a perplexing reality. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of intestinal cells from UC patients receiving tofacitinib to identify the cellular subsets and genes involved in the response and/or resistance to tofacitinib.
